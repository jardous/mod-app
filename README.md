mod-app
=======

This is a work-in-progress desktop application of the MOD LV2 host and UI server, natively integrated in the OS (no external web browser needed).

In order to run this application you need to have mod-python, mod-ui and mod-ui installed system-wide.

Binary builds will be available at a later date.
